# gsuite

The [`gsuite.toml`](gsuite.toml) file holds the configuration for the GSuite
users and groups. It can be updated with the
[`gadmin`](https://github.com/oxidecomputer/gadmin) tool. Follow the
instructions in the gadmin repo for getting credentials via the Google
developer console and then run:

```
$ gadmin gsuite.toml
```
